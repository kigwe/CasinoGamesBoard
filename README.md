# The Casino Games Board
## By: Kelechi Igwe
The Casino Games Board is the final project for my CPE 233: Computer Design and Assembly Language Programming class. This project consists of an assembly file that runs on an OTTER, which is an implementation of the RISC-V architecture. Throughout the course, students had to incrementally build the components of an ISA (ALU, Control Unit, Register File, etc.). By the end of the quarter, each student knew how to recreate our teacher's implementation of the architecture. From there, we were allowed to create any final project that used the OTTER on a Diligent Basys3 FPGA board. For my project, I decided to create an assembly program that simulates a casino.

## About
The Casino Games Board allows a user to use an FPGA to play casino games like Slots and Blackjack to earn virtual money. Although there is no use of the money earned in this program, it is a fun thing to use from time to time.

## How to Play
You Will Need:
1. Basys3 FPGA
2. Vivado (or another program that allows you to put a bitstream onto the FPGA)

Instructions:
1. Connect the Bays3 Board to your computer.
2. Load Vivado and open the hardware manager.
3. Connect to the target (Basys3 Board) by using Auto Connect or by manually connecting to it.
4. Click on Program device and select CGBBitstream.bit.
5. Enjoy!
